## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I am going to be creating a booking application. As a dj I always have people contact me to book me for different shows - weddings, corporate events, birthdays, fashion shows, club events etc. It can be tiring having to go over the diifferent conditions for different shows and the charges for each shows. I currently do not have an agent and thus I do all the booking myself. I would like the app to have all the categories of shows I DJ for where a future client can just log on and find all the information he needs to book me for a show. The app will also make use of a calendar that makes any dates that I have been booked for unavailable. 

### Features
Calendar - Users will be able to see my available or unavailable dates on the calendar
Categories - Users will see the different categories of events I DJ for - weddings, corporate events, birthdays, fashion shows, club events etc
Terms - They will be able to see my terms for each category above - down payment, charges etc.
Create Booking - Users will be able to create a booking

### Technologies
Java Spring
Python
MySQL
SQLAlchemy
Jinja2 templates
Flask

### What I'll Have to Learn
I will have to learn some JavaScript, how to utilize the google calendar and also how to send email/text confirmations to users once a booking is confirmed.
